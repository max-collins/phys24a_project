    "Where $a_{\\text{p}}$ is the semi-major axis from the sun of some planet p, $\\epsilon_{\\text{p}}$ is the eccentricity of orbit of some planet p, and $\\theta_{0,p}$ is the initial angular displacement from the horizontal at time = 0 for some planet p (here we take time = 0) to be the time at which we start simulating the solar system. This gives us an equation which relates the radial distance from the sun for a given planet p at some angular diplacement from the starting angle ($\\theta_{0,p}$), namely this displacement from the starting angle at some time is $\\theta_{p}$, for $\\theta_{0,p} = 0 $ this gives the angular displacement from the horizontal at some time. let us illustrate the what an orbit looks like for some planet p below.\n",
