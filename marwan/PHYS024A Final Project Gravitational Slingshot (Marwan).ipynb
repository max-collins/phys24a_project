This gives us an equation which relates the radial distance from the sun for a given planet p at some angular diplacement from the starting angle ($\\theta_{0,\\text{p}}$), namely this displacement from the starting angle at some time is $\\theta_{\\text{p}}$, for $\\theta_{0,\\text{p}} = 0 $ this gives the angular displacement from the horizontal at some time. let us illustrate the what an orbit looks like for some planet p below. \n",
