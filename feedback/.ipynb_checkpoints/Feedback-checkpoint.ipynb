    "You folks took on a very ambitious project and did a credible job of it. The first major challenge was to develop the equations of motion for the satellite, and I am impressed that you pulled it off in polar coordinates (which is significantly more challenging than resorting to Cartesians). I haven't done careful tests of relative accuracy, but there is a certain elegance to the approach you took.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ In a sense, you face an extraordinary hurdle in attempting to answer the question you have posed. Simulations that last for a large number of orbits take a good deal of time, unless the satellite happens to crash into another celestial body or be ejected from the solar system. One must always worry in simulating over such long times whether the numerical errors accumulating during the simulation take the system unacceptably far from the true path it would follow. Coming up with test metrics to ensure that your equations of motion are working and that the errors are acceptably bounded are *very important* to this kind of project and I would have liked to see some effort to demonstrate that you have the numerics under control. For example, if you launch the satellite in a circular orbit and reduce the planet’s mass to be a tiny fraction of the Sun’s, do you see the behavior you expect?\n",
    "    \n",
    "+ A subtle point about how `solve_ivp` uses the `derivatives` function: to bound the error, it sometimes has to calculate values for inappropriate time steps, since it can't tell that they are inappropriate (leading to excessive error) until it has looked into the consequences. Therefore, if you set global flags inside the derivatives function, they may get tripped for a step that ends up not being taken, potential confusing the interpretation of results.\n",
    "    \n",
    "+ Coming up with a reasonable criterion for “having been swept” is a project in itself; I’m not sure I have a decent criterion. Prof. Tamayo, who joins us this summer and whose research focuses on this very problem, will be able to enlighten all of us and I look forward to discussing your project with him. Perhaps one reasonable criterion would be that if the satellite’s orbit is perturbed enough to make it cross the orbit of the next closest planet, it will be swept. I was too lazy to include a second planet and just used the criterion that the satellite’s orbit was sufficiently perturbed if its distance from the Sun changed by more than 10%, having been set up in a circular orbit. I'll supply some more details at the bottom of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ I have marked in red below a couple of spots where I think the algebra could be cleaned up.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ I was puzzled for awhile on running your code that the satellite was going backward compared to the planet. I figured out that you had installed a $-1$ in the initial angular velocity, presumably just to goof off and try something, so I removed that to observe the simulation. I’m not sure I understand the rationale for asked for 1000 frames; I never caught something truly dramatic.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Great work on a challenging problem. I’m not sure I understand what the results are supposed to mean, but I appreciate how much work had to go into managing even the first simulation. In the end, though, I think that you need to simulate for significantly longer to make any claims about the influence of the planet on the satellite.\n",

    "## A formal investigation into how Pluto tragically lost its planethood\n",
    "### Collin Fitzpatrick, Alejandro Wang, Alan Wu\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "According to the International Astronomical Union, a celestial body must meet three criteria to be considered a planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It must orbit a star (in our cosmic neighborhood, the Sun). \n",
    "2. It must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape. \n",
    "3. It must be big enough that its gravity cleared away any other objects of a similar size near its orbit around the Sun. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "We would like to build a simulation that can model how a large planet object orbiting the sun interacts with smaller bodies in its path. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some questions we have include:\n",
    "- How big must the planet be relative to the bodies in order to clear the orbit?\n",
    "- Where do the small bodies end up? As moons? Thrown out of solar system? Thrown into the planet or the sun?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Setup\n",
    "**note that all variables with subscript j refer to the planet (as if it was jupiter)*\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"phys24Image2.jpeg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "From independent variables $r$, $r_j$, $\\theta_1$, and $\\theta_2$ we can derive expressions for the distance $s$ between the orbiting bodies and the angle $\\theta_3$ between the planet and the sun with the small body at the vertex.\n",

    "The strategy I settled on was to place the satellite in a circular orbit parameterized by radius and initial orbital angular position compared to the planet. I chose to parameterize the radius by a relative value. If the planet has the semimajor axis $a$, the radius of the initial circular orbit of the satellite is $(1 + \\delta r)a$. The planet always starts at $\\theta = 0$ and the satellite at $\\Delta\\theta$, which spans $(0, 2\\pi)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used two criteria for terminating the integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The satellite's deviation $r = r_0$ from its initial radius exceeded a preset value (which I chose to be 10% of its initial radius). \n",
    "2. The satellite passed within the radius of a planet, indicating that it had crashed into the planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "If neither of these occurred during a time interval of 1000 periods of the planet, the orbit was not determined to be unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To plot, I show the base-10 logarithm of the simulation time (in years) using the color plotted at ($\\delta r$, $\\Delta\\theta$). The plot below shows how the satellite fared for a range of radii and starting angular positions under the influence of Jupiter in its known elliptical orbit (and having its known mass). If the satellite’s radial position is far enough away from Jupiter’s semimajor axis on the Sun's side, the satellite completes 1000 orbits without problem (which appears as the very light pink reagion on the left of the plot). There is an interesting region near Jupiter’s radius ($\\delta r \\approx 0$) where the satellite is apparently stable (at least for 1000 orbits), provided that it does not start too close to Jupiter. I suspect that if I were to simulate for 10 times as long, this region would shrink appreciably. My intuition is that if you are that close, you will get swept up in due time. What was more interesting to me was the broad range of starting radial positions that were sufficiently perturbed over 1000 orbits to trigger condition 1.\n",

I would be reluctant to make any real claims without comparing these simulations to ones lasting 10 or 100 times longer.
